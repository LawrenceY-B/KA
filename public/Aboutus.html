        <h1>The Mission</h1>
        </br>
        <p>
          Kingdom Ambassadors is a non-denominational youth movement that began
          in the year 2019.This movement was formed with the aim of gathering
          the masses for Christ and raising radical believers who will take the
          kingdom of God and it's beliefs and principles and shamelessly spread
          it abroad.Another major vision for the move is to bring out the hidden
          potentials and gifts in people and train them to exploit it and use it
          for the glory of the Kingdom. We are on a unique mission in the body
          of Christ.Though the movement is a youth movement, adults also manage
          to join us in fellowship'
